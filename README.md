**DayZ Any.Map.Project Client**
================

Main goal: One DayZ based client and server build that will run on any arma2 map as it was released by the creator. DayZ A.M.P will be updated to current DayZ builds quickly.

**Changes**
========================

* Added - Rocket_DZ skin is now droppable drops on Helicopter crashes.
* Added - Missing building loot and zombie spawns for many buildings on custom maps.
* Added - Missing fuel tanks and water well for other map support.
* Added - 50% chance that zombies will attack you in a vehicle. ( More damage will be done to Wheels and Glass less to Body, Engine, and Fuel.)
* Added - New rare canned meat product.
* Fixed - UI Control error on right click inside gear menu.
