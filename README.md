**DayZ Any.Map.Project Client**
================

Main goal: One DayZ based client and server build that will run on any arma2 map as it was released by the creator. DayZ A.M.P will be updated to current DayZ builds quickly.

**Changes**
========================

* Added - Rocket_DZ skin is now droppable.
* Added - Missing building loot and zombie spawns for many buildings on custom maps. (still needs more work)

* Removed - All banned classes.
* Removed - Auto refuel Land_Ind_FuelStation_Feed_Ep1 fuel station.
* Removed - Force save in favor of server side induced auto save.
* Removed - Some .RPT log spam client side related to zombie LOS checks.
* Change - Allow dayz_maxLocalZombies to be set from the init.sqf mission file server side. If not set reverts to default 40.
